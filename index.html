    <p><b>Bio:</b> I am Tim Larson, a fifth year student at the University of St Thomas! I am majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Aerospace Studies. I am on track to commision
    into the United States Air Force in May, where I will be an Operations Research Analyst! During my time in the Air Force I look forawrd to pursuing a masters degree in Data Analytics
    through the Air Force Institute of Technology at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, near Dayton Ohio. Another cool oppurtunity I am interested in through the Air Force is the possibility
    of becoming a test pilot. After the Air Force, I hope to work for a government agency like the NSA or FBI.</p>
