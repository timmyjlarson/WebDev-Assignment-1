This project was created as a part of CISC 375 Web Development, taken during the Fall semester of my final year at St Thomas. This website includes some dynamic sizing features, a dropdown menu, and several pages to include a wide spread of information about me. I used the foundations framework for the CSS, and the HTML is made without any extensions. This website was intended to serve as an introduction to who I am, so it includes information about my hobbies, my family, and my projects outside of class.
