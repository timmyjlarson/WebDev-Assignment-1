            <h1> Hobbies, Aspirations, and Fun Facts</h1>
            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Cars: </b>I enjoy working on cars. I have a 1972 Chevelle and a 1999 Chevy K2500. I spend most of the summer months working on them. Current projects include
                an interior restoration on the Chevelle with modern insturments and entertainment systems, with plans for some modern drive train upgrades like positraction and disc brakes.
                I also hope to either do an LS swap on it or put a 454 in there, but I definetly have to do better than 50 year old drum breaks and 20 year old tires first. As far as the truck
                goes, my only real plans for it are to make sure it is a capable tow rig for hauling the Chevelle around wherever the Air Force may take me.</li>
                <li><b>Computers: </b>What kind of computer scence major would I be if I didn't enjoy computers? Last J-Term I built (most of) my PC. I built one for my brother last spring, and am
                currently helping my fiancee's ADD WEIRD E THING brother build one as well. I have been getting a little into PC gaming too, so if you have any recommendations for good games let me
                know!</li>
                <li><b>Outdoors: </b>I love the outdoors! In high school I was in the BSA and got my Eagle Scout. My favorite place in the world is in a hammock on a lake surronded by tall pines
                and mountains. This last summer my fiancee ADD WEIRD E THING and I spent a week camping in Manitoba, Canada where we saw sand dunes, lakes that never freeze, and bears. Some of my
                favorite locations I have been to include the Grand Tetons in Wyomming, Arches National in Utah, the Black Canyon of the Gunnison in Colorado, and Riding Mountain National in Manitoba.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Aspirations</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Acedemic: </b>I hope to get my Masters in Data Analytics from the Air Force Institute of Technology after graduating from the University of St Thomas.</li>
                <li><b>Professional: </b>I have always wanted to be an officer in the Air Force, and I am mere months away from accomplishing a life-long dream of mine. I plan on making the most of
                the opportunity and seeing where life takes me.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Always Moving: </b>Growing up I moved 10 times and attended 7 different schools before I graduated high school. Considering the average American lives in 11 homes in their
                lifetime, I am well on track to surpassing that number!</li>
